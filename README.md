# OB-WSPES
OB-WSPES is a uniform evaluation system for obfuscation-based web search privacy.
crawler: crawl url from the search engine with the given query.
obfuscation\_mechanism: integrate Goopir,nispp,nqi,tmn and praw obfaction mechanisms.
attack: integrate Random Forest(rf), Support Vector Machine (svm), Naive Bayes (nb), Gradient Boosting Classifier (gbc), Logistic Regression (lr), Nearest Centroid (nc), Decision Tree Classifier (dtc), Multiplayer Perception (mlp), Kmeans, and Simattack methods.
utility: integrate number of query char, query entropy, distribution distance of level 1 categories in the ODP taxonomy, ODP level 1 category entropy, distribution distance of level 2 categories in the ODP taxonomy, ODP level 2 category entropy, Jaccard distance of personalization of web search, Edit distance of personalization web search and user profile.
